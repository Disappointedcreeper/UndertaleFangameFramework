This is a framework for Undertale fangames in the Godot gameengine, written in C#, so I don't know how well it will work with GDScript.
Currently it is in a very incomplete state, but is being actively developed.

You may use this for any project you want, monitized or not, as long as you provide sufficient credit to me (disappointedcreeper.)
